# Icebreaker nMigen Life

This repo contains an [nMigen](https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen) program to run
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
on an [iCEBreaker
FPGA](https://1bitsquared.com/collections/fpga/products/icebreaker),
using the [12-bit DVI
pmod](https://1bitsquared.com/products/pmod-digital-video-interface).

[Here's a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exh4Jo7Ki44) showing it in action.

This is my first significant piece of code in nMigen. I hope it will serve as
useful examples or counter-examples for others just starting out with nMigen.

DISCLAIMER: This is a personal project. This is not an officially supported
Google product.
